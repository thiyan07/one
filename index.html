<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<div class="box">
<p id="hobbies" ><pre >🎯 Hobbies & Interests </pre>
<p >Outside of academics, I love spending my time exploring new technologies and experimenting with mini coding projects that challenge my logic and creativity.
 I enjoy playing strategy-based mobile and PC games, especially MMORPGs, which not only help me relax but also teach me about teamwork and adaptability.

One of my biggest passions is watching anime. For me, anime is not just entertainment
 — it's a creative universe that teaches life lessons, discipline, imagination, and emotion through storytelling. 
 Some shows have even inspired me to explore Japanese culture and language, and I’ve started picking up basic Japanese phrases out of pure interest.</pre></p>
